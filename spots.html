      <h2>Oakland Cemetery</h2>
      <p>The Historic Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta began as six acres in 1850. It was originally designed as a garden cemetery. Over the years, particularly during the time of the Civil War, the site grew, accommodating those killed on the battlefield. Eventually the cemetery came to encompass 88 acres. In 1884 the cemetery stopped selling plots. Eventually this once lovely cemetery fell into disrepair as those tending the plots moved away or died.</p>

      <h2>Dancing Fountains at Centennial Olympic Park</h2>

      <h2>Stone Mountain Park</h2>
      <p>One of the most popular places to visit near Atlanta is Stone Mountain Park, 16 miles east of the city center in DeKalb County.

Lee, hewn from the rock between 1923 and 1970.</p>
