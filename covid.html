        <p style="color: white;"> According to survey from Atlanta regional commission:<p>
          
          <ul style="color: white;">
              <li>Nearly half (45%) of all respondents said that they either had hours or waged reduced, or had to quit for safety reasons.</li>
          <li> Nearly 58% said they knew someone who had contracted COVID-19.</li>
          <li>One-third of workers said they had worked from home as a result of the pandemic.</li>
          <li>Nearly 12% of survey respondents named race relations as the regionâ€™s biggest concern, compared to just 4% in 2019.</li>
          <li>90% said they agreed or strongly agreed that discrimination against Black people is a serious problem, compared to 64% of those age 65 and older.</li>
          <li> Survey results are statistically valid for each of those 10 counties and the city of Atlanta, with a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5% for the 10-county region as a whole and plus or minus 3.8% to 5% for the individual jurisdictions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="color: white;"> This survey clearly suggest that Atlanta took a great hit due to Covid and not only Atlanta alone but the whole country</p>
