# Atlanta-
Atlanta- The city of Lifestyle!
This is a project of TechTogether Atlanta Hackathon. Our team created a fully responsive website named ATLANTA-The city of lifestyle together on the theme “hack for Atlanta with Microsoft”,  which will definitely give you a short tour of  Atlanta, be it’s about famous places, traditions, festivals, tasty food corners, everything that will make you want to visit it once.
We used frontend languages, CSS, HTML and JS.
